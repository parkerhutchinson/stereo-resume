Team @ Grafana Labs,

I am writing to express my interest in the position of Senior Front-End Web Developer at Grafana Labs. With my background in building and maintaining web experiences, particularly with modern tech stacks like Next.js, React, and Sanity.io, I believe I can contribute significantly to your team.

As the primary maintainer of the web experience at Retool, I gained hands-on experience with key technologies similar to those listed in your job description, including Next.js, React, and various CMS platforms. I was responsible for maintaining and optimizing the companyâ€™s website, improving the functionality, performance, and developer experience. My efforts led to a migration from Contentful and Gatsby to Vercel, Next.js, and Sanity, which resulted in enhanced developer workflows, improved performance metrics such as FCP and TTI, and better overall scalability.

In addition to my technical expertise, I was tasked with evaluating tech stacks to improve development processes. I conducted research and analysis of alternative CMS and backend solutions, ensuring a smooth transition to a more efficient and scalable environment. These skills would directly apply to your need for integrating a new headless CMS and designing scalable API architecture at Grafana Labs.

Furthermore, my experience working closely with design teams to create interactive experiences aligns well with your desire for a creative thought leader who can craft engaging user experiences. I have consistently focused on implementing high-quality, user-friendly pages that drive growth and lead generation while adhering to established design systems. I am also well-versed in component-based development best practices and have optimized websites for both performance and SEO.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my experience aligns with your needs in more detail. Please feel free to contact me at [Your Phone Number] or via email at [Your Email Address] to schedule an interview.

Sincerely,
Parker Hutchinson
